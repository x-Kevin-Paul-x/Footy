## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Must Fix Immediately:

1. Database persistence integration
2. Transfer window duration and realism
3. Player training balance
4. Financial system basic implementation
5. Match cards and substitutions

### Should Fix Soon:

1. Manager AI simplification
2. Frontend search and navigation
3. Injury system affecting lineups
4. Home advantage in matches
5. Contract expiry system

### Nice to Have Later:

1. European competitions
